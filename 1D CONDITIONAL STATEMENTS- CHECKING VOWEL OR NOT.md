## Experiment No: 1d â€“ Conditional Statements- Checking Divisible or not

## AIM  
To Write a Python program   to read a number and check whether the number is divisible by both 9 and 5 or not using  if else statement.
## ALGORITHM  
1)Start
2)Input an integer n from the user.
3)Check if n is divisible by both 5 and 9:
4)Use the condition n % 5 == 0 and n % 9 == 0
5)If True, print "n is divisible by both 5 and 9"
6)Else, print "n is NOT divisible by both 5 and 9"
7)End
## PROGRAM
```python
# Reg.No-212223060292
# Name-Toya Talyna E
# Write your code here
n=int(input())
if n%5==0 and n%9==0:
    print(f"{n} is divisible by both 5 and 9")
else:
    print(f"{n} is NOT divisible by both 5 and 9")


```

## RESULT
Thus  a Python program   to read a number and check whether the number is divisible by both 9 and 5 or not using  if else statement is done and verified.
